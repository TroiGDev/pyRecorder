pyRecorder is a simple script that creates fixed framerate videos from pygame windows

Before use note that it saves all individual photos taken during the recording as .png files in the working directory that have to be manualy removed, and when the final video is generated it takes ALL .png images in the working directory, so make sure to NOT HAVE ANY EXTRA .PNG FILES IN THE WORKING DIRECTORY WHEN RECORDING otherwise you will have random frames of the extra .pngs

For examples of implementation look at Plants.py and Magma.py (in Source) which are both gameoflife cellular automaton implementations

This version is very rough as it has many problems:
	it slows down the render
	it doesnt delete past .png shots automaticaly
	the video framerate can be adjusted (recommended 24FPS) but no calibration is in place to make the final video the avarage frame rate of the actual render
		therefore the final video may be slower or faster than the render without pyRecorder
